## üöÄ How LLM Enhances NanoFetch

### 1. **Flexible Query Enhancement**
- **Problem:** User queries can be long, complex, or overly specific, which might limit PubMed search results.
- **LLM Solution:**
  - The OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model is used to **refine and simplify user queries**, extracting the core concepts for a broader and more accurate search.
  - Example:
    - **User Query:** "Use of nanobots in day-to-day life and machinery industry"
    - **LLM-Enhanced Query:** "Nanobot applications in industry and daily life"

### 2. **Automated Summarization of Abstracts**
- **Problem:** Research papers often contain lengthy abstracts, making it time-consuming to grasp key insights.
- **LLM Solution:**
  - The LLM generates **concise summaries** of research abstracts, providing a quick overview without reading the entire text.
  - Example Summary:
    - *"This research discusses the advancements in nanobot applications for industrial machinery and everyday technology, highlighting efficiency improvements and future prospects."*

### 3. **Fallback Logic for Quota Management**
- **Problem:** When the OpenAI API quota is exhausted, it could interrupt the process.
- **LLM Solution:**
  - The system is designed to **gracefully skip LLM features** when the quota is exhausted.
  - It continues fetching research data and logs a warning for transparency.

### 4. **Detailed Logging for Debugging**
- **Problem:** Debugging complex processes involving LLMs can be challenging.
- **LLM Solution:**
  - Comprehensive logging is implemented to trace:
    - When LLM features are used.
    - When they are skipped due to quota issues.
    - Any errors that occur during LLM processing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Handling Quota Exhaustion
- If the API quota is exceeded, the system:
  - Skips LLM query enhancement and summarization.
  - Logs a warning in the output for easy debugging.
  - Marks the summary as "Summary not available due to quota limits."

## ‚úÖ Why LLM Integration Matters
- **Improved Search Results:** Ensures broader and more relevant research findings.
- **Time-Efficient Insights:** Summarizes key information, saving time.
- **User-Friendly Experience:** Handles errors gracefully without interrupting the data-fetching process.
